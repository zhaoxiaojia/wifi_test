"""High-level helpers to control a USB relay device.

This module defines byte-level command constants, default serial settings,
and utility functions for normalizing port names and wiring modes.  The
:class:`UsbRelayDevice` encapsulates serial communication with the relay
hardware and exposes context manager semantics for automatic opening and
closing.  Top-level functions allow callers to apply, pulse and hold
relay states.  Global variables are annotated using :class:`~typing.Annotated`
