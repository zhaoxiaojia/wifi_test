"""YAML file loading and query helper utilities.

This module defines a :class:`yamlTool` class that resolves a YAML file
relative to the configuration base directory and provides methods for
loading and accessing its contents.  Errors during loading are logged,
and multiple encodings are attempted to support different file origins.
