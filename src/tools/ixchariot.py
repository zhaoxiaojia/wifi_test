"""Utilities for interacting with Ixia chassis via Tcl scripts.

This module defines a simple wrapper around the execution of a Tcl script used
to measure receiver sensitivity or throughput between pairs of endpoints.  It
encapsulates the details of constructing command lines, launching the script,
and parsing the output for summary statistics.  Consumers of this module can
instantiate the :class:`ix` class to run the script with different parameters
and to modify the underlying Tcl script as needed.

class ix:
    """Represents a thin wrapper around an RVR Tcl script invocation.

    The ix class provides methods to execute a Tcl script that measures the
    average throughput between two endpoints and to modify the script on disk.
    It stores endpoint information and the path to the script as instance
    attributes.

    Parameters:
        ep1 (str, optional): The first endpoint identifier used by the script.
            Defaults to an empty string.
        ep2 (str, optional): The second endpoint identifier used by the script.
            Defaults to an empty string.

        This method updates the instance attributes if new endpoint or pairing
        values are provided.  It then constructs a command line using the
        stored script path and endpoint identifiers and launches it in a
        subprocess.  After a fixed wait period the output is read and a
        regular expression is used to extract a floating-point "avg" value
        reported by the script.

        Parameters:
            ep1 (str, optional): Overrides the stored first endpoint identifier
                for this invocation. Defaults to the existing value.

                this invocation. Defaults to the existing value.

            str | bool: The extracted average throughput as a string if found,
            otherwise ``False`` indicating that the script did not produce a
            parseable result.
